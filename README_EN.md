## English | [中文](https://github.com/xuelongqy/flutter_easyrefresh/blob/master/README.md)

Just like the name, EasyRefresh can easily implement pull-down refresh and upload operations on Flutter applications. It supports almost all Flutter controls, but only if they are wrapped in ScrollView. Its functions are similar to Android's Smart Refresh Layout, and it also draws on the advantages of many tripartite libraries. EasyRefresh integrates various styles of Headers and Footers, but it has no limitations. You can easily customize it. Using Flutter's powerful animation, even a simple control can be done. EasyRefresh aims to build a strong, stable and mature drop-down refresh framework for Flutter.

## Features:

 - Support android (halo), ios (cross springback) effect
 - Support arbitrary ScrollView controls, if not for easy encapsulation (so the theory is that all controls)
 - Support custom and has integrated a lot of cool Header and Footer
 - Support pull refresh, on the load (automatically)
 - Support the Header and Footer list embedded and view the floating two forms

....
  // For the Header and Footer EasyRefresh will update, in order to maintain unity with the user operating state, you must set up the key
  // Different Header and Footer may have different parameter Settings
